### Published projects 

#### Comparing the predictors of mutability among healthy human tissues inferred from mutations in single-cell genome data [link](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/229/3/iyae215/8015402?login=true)

Ever wondered what causes mutation within you? The truth is that many processes and chemicals affect whether sites in the genome mutate, which includes the many molcules that exist innately within cells  (ie. transcription machinery, epigenetic marks). In this paper I leverage data from prexisiting pexeriments and build a machine learning models that predicts mutations in healathy tissues. I created highly accurate models (wihtin 2% error), and explore the question: are the factors that predict mutation consistent across tissues, or do they differ? 


#### How Sequence Context-Dependent Mutability Drives Mutation Rate Variation in the Genome  [link](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/genetics/iyae215)

One of the main factors that affects the likelihood of a site to mutate is actually the DNA itself (i.e. is the site an A/T/C/G?). However when a site mutates, the base will change and therefore its likelihood to mutate in the future also changes. This raises interesting questions about how genetic sequences evolve over time, which I address here in this paper using a simulated chromosome. 



### Teaching experience 
Outside of research I'm very passionate about improving the undergraduate learning experience. I hold numerous roles in UTM academic student support programs including as a Senior Program Assistant at the [Facilitated Study Group Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/asc/facilitated-study-groups-fsgs) and heading the [International Mentorship in Academic and Canadian Culture Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/language-studies/experiential-learning/imacc).
