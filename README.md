I'm a PhD student at the [Ness lab](https://ness.bio/) at the [University of Toronto Mississauga](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/biology/). I am broadly interested in human cancer & aging and use computation approaches to explore how mutation rate varies and plays a role in human health. 

Outside of research I'm very passionate about improving the undergraduate learning experience. I hold numerous roles in UTM academic student support programs including as a Senior Program Assistant at the [Facilitated Study Group Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/asc/facilitated-study-groups-fsgs) and heading the [International Mentorship in Academic and Canadian Culture Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/language-studies/experiential-learning/imacc).

The rate of mutations varies >100-fold across the genome, altering the rate of evolution, and susceptibility to genetic diseases. The strongest predictor of mutation rate is the sequence itself, varying 75-fold between trinucleotides. The fact that DNA sequence drives its own mutation rate raises a simple but important prediction; highly mutable sequences will mutate more frequently and eliminate themselves in favor of sequences with lower mutability, leading to a lower equilibrium mutation rate. However, purifying selection constrains changes in mutable sequences, causing higher rates of mutation. We conduct a simulation using real human mutation data to test if 1) DNA evolves to a low equilibrium mutation rate and 2) purifying selection causes a higher equilibrium mutation rate in the genomeâ€™s most important regions. We explore how this simple process affects sequence evolution in the genome, and discuss the implications for modeling evolution and susceptibility to DNA damage.
